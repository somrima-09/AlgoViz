Project Name: AlgoViz

Demo:

Features:

  1.Visualization of popular sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort).
  
  2.Interactive controls to modify sorting parameters (array size, speed of visualization).

  3.Real-time visualization of algorithm steps.
  
  4.Comparison between different algorithms on the same input data.
  
  5.Ability to reset and generate new random arrays for sorting.

Technologies Used:

  1.Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  
  2.Deployment: GitHub Pages

Usage:

  1.Selecting and visualizing different sorting algorithms
  
  2.Adjusting visualization settings (speed, array size)
  
  3.Understanding the visualized steps and outcomes of each algorithm
