**Project Name: AlgoViz**

**Demo:**

**Features:**

  1.Implemented algorithms:
  
      Bubble sort
      
      Selection sort
      
      Insertion sort
      
      Merge sort
      
      Quick sort
      
      Heap sort

  2.Colored representation of step being executed:
  
    1) Blue:default
   
    2) Yellow: Being compared
    
    3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
    
    4) Green: In correct position
  
  3.Interactive controls to modify sorting parameters (array size, speed of visualization).

  4.Real-time visualization of algorithm steps.
  
  5.Comparison between different algorithms on the same input data and ability to reset and generate new random arrays for sorting.

**Technologies Used:**

  _1.Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript_
  
 _ 2.Deployment: GitHub Pages_
  
**Usage:**

  1.Selecting and visualizing different sorting algorithms
  
  2.Adjusting visualization settings (speed, array size)
  
  3.Understanding the visualized steps and outcomes of each algorithm
