Project Name: AlgoViz

Demo:

Features:

  Visualization of popular sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort)
  Interactive controls to modify sorting parameters (array size, speed of visualization)
  Real-time visualization of algorithm steps
  Comparison between different algorithms on the same input data
  Ability to reset and generate new random arrays for sorting

Technologies Used:

  Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  Deployment: GitHub Pages

Usage:

  Selecting and visualizing different sorting algorithms
  Adjusting visualization settings (speed, array size)
  Understanding the visualized steps and outcomes of each algorithm
